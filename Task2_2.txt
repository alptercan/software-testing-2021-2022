In the switch cases, the default case is 0. The default case can be used when the case is not true.
Since we do cannot use the NOTYPE type, I cannot test this case in order to increase the coverage.
The test I wrote for the default case should not even know about the code in a method. 
(Switch statements can have an optional default case, and it makes the code more maintainable).
default:
				result = 0;


In the toString() method, we can see the method comes from OptionMap class. 
The subclass should pass all the unit tests for the superclass, but overriding a method can fail the relevant unit tests.
@Override
	public String toString() {
		return optionMap.toString();
	}
